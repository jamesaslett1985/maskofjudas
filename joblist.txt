BACKGROUND IMAGES

have a look into the Picture html5 element

like, have a div of class 'image' or whatever
set a width and height, and set your band image as a css background image
that way, you can change what the image displayed is, based on screen size, or pixel depth
the picture element does the same thing, its v clever
it basically has built-in media queries, that can include screen size and/or pixel depth etc
to show only that image

when i say 'background'
i mean CSS background images, not neccessary an actual image in the background
if you've got a square image, you can make a square div, and assign your square img as a background-image in CSS
and the div can be stacked, stretched, etc in the same way a normal img element could be
but you get this additional control over what image is loaded when and where
