that left position the little hover guy is using is in relation to the very left of the screen
in order to position something absolutely, you gotta have a parent element set to 'relative'
chuck width on your UL, set it positioned relative
and then the little hover effect guy will refer to that fixed-width UL element to place the :after absolutely?

your UL is currently 100% wide
so that left position added to the hover guy is using the very edge of the UL, ie, the very left of the screen to position it
and as its changing width as you move the browser, those hard pixel values dont match up to your percentage width

you can make it as wide you non-mobile breakpoint
just margin:0 auto it to centre the UL, then the hover will have a solid number to work with
that way, it wont break if you add more items

you could add the current section as a class to your UL
and use that class in CSS to position the left of the hover


generally best to never do CSS in JS if you can avoid it
the only way to override it is !Important
then you've burned all your  bridges
plus its shitty to update etc

that way, you can easily expand the styles,
hell, place it on the body tag or something, so you can target any element at any 'active' section state
